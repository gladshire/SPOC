# Setting Up Conda and Creating the SPOC Environment (Linux)

## Step 1: Install Miniconda (if conda is not already installed)

1. **Download Miniconda:**

   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Install Miniconda:**

   ```bash
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions and accept the default options.

3. **Initialize Conda (if not done automatically):**

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Verify the installation:**

   ```bash
   conda --version
   ```

## Step 2: Create SPOC Conda Environment to Load Necessary Dependencies

1. **Create the environment:**

   ```bash
   conda env create -f SPOC/environment.yml
   ```

2. **Activate the SPOC environment:**

   ```bash
   conda activate spoc_venv
   ```

## Step 3: Run SPOC to Analyze Predictions

SPOC is designed to analyze complexes containing only pairs of human proteins run in at least 3 AlphaFold 2 multimer models.
The program will ignore any complexes that do not meet the above criteria.
The program will attempt to use all available CPUs to maximally parallelize the run and minimize runtime.
The program does not require any specific naming formats for the files (besides the words unrelaxed in the filename), as it extracts sequences from the PDB files directly to determine which proteins are in which files.

```bash
python3 SPOC/run.py my_afm_predictions_folder
```

```bash
python3 SPOC/run.py my_afm_predictions_folder_01 my_afm_predictions_folder_02
```

```bash
python3 SPOC/run.py my_afm_predictions_folder_0?
```

```bash
python3 SPOC/run.py my_afm_predictions_folder_0? --name_filter MCM --output only_mcm_complexes
```

See all available options by running:

```bash
python3 SPOC/run.py --help
```

## Step 4: Understanding SPOC Outputs

After running SPOC, the output files will be generated in the location where you initiated the run script.

1. **{your_analyzed_folder}_SPOC_analysis.csv**

   This file provides a summary of analyzed predictions, including key metrics such as SPOC and other measurements of predicted structural accuracy and omic data linking the proteins in analyzed pairs.

   **Columns explanation:**
   - `complex_name`: Name of the analyzed protein complex.
   - `spoc_score`: Overall SPOC confidence score. 1 is best and 0 is worst. The higher the better.
   - `avg_n_models`: Average number of models for all inter-residue conacts found in the analysis. Normalized by number of models run (Always 3 for SPOC). 1 is best and 0 is worst.
   - `max_n_models`: Maximum number of models for all inter-residue conacts found in the analysis. Normalized by number of models run (Always 3 for SPOC). 1 is best and 0 is worst.
   - `num_contacts_with_max_n_models`: Number of contacts observed in the most models across all those analyzed.
   - `num_unique_contacts`: Total unique residue contacts found across all analyzed models.
   - `mean_contacts_across_predictions`: Mean number of contacts found across all analyzed models.
   - `min_contacts_across_predictions`: Minimum number of contacts observed across all analyzed models.
   - `iptm_mean`: Mean interface predicted template modeling score across all analyzed models.
   - `iptm_min`: Minimum interface predicted template modeling score across all analyzed models.
   - `iptm_max`: Maximum interface predicted template modeling score across all analyzed models.
   - `models_checked`: IDs of models that were processed. If more than 3 models are available, the program will randomlly choose 3.
   - `uniprot_ids`: UniProt IDs that were matched to the protein sequyences found in the file for the given complex.
   - `sequence`: Protein sequences extracted from the PDB file associated with the given complex.
   - `best_num_residue_contacts`: Number of contacts (residue pairs) found at the protein-protein interface in the single "best" model.
   - `best_if_residues`: Best number of interacting residues found in the protein-protein interface in the single "best" model.
   - `best_plddt_max`: Maximum predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) score for any residue found in the protein-protein interface in the single "best" model.
   - `best_pae_min`: Minimum Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) score across all residue pairs in the protein-protein interface of the single "best" model.
   - `best_contact_score_max`: Maximum score for predicted contacts in the single "best" model.
   - `best_num_significant_afm_scores`: Best number of significant AlphaMissense scores (> 80) for residues at the protein-protein interface in the single "best" model.
   - `crispr_jaccard`: Jaccard similarity score for CRISPR data.
   - `crispr_shared_hit_count`: Count of shared CRISPR hits for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `co_expression_score`: Score indicating co-expression pattern (from CoExpressDB) for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `t5_embedding_cosine_dist`: Cosine distance between T5 embeddings for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `t5_embedding_euclidian_dist`: Euclidean distance between T5 embeddings for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `depmap_cosine_dist`: Cosine distance in DepMap data for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `depmap_euclidian_dist`: Euclidean distance in DepMap data for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `depmap_abs_diff`: Absolute difference in DepMap values for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `colocalization_match_score`: Score indicating how well the predicted DeepLoc 2.0 localization vectors match for both proteins in the analyzed pair.
   - `biogrid_detect_count`: Number of times an interaction between the analyzed proteins in the pair was detected in BioGRID.

   Any complexes that could not be analyzed in the specified folder will be listed in a new document: **{your_analyzed_folder}_errored_complexes.csv**

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the input AlphaFold multimer models are in the correct format (.pdb files) and that they have corresponding JSON PAE files.
- If you encounter any errors, check the console output to help debug any issues.
